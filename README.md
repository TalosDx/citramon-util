#### Why one more utility?  
At my first job, there was a lot of pain caused by the poor quality of the code, it was impossible to connect external libraries, and those that were were old.  
Guava & apache commons may be the solution for you.  
I wanted to write utilities anew from scratch, which helped me at work.
